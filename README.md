Bootcamp Prework Study Guide for Students (and Myself)
# <Coding Bootcamp Study Guide>

## Description

In order to prepare myself for the bootcamp soon, I engaged and completed the pre-work course. This entailed learning basic information about HTML, CSS,
Git commands, and JavaScript as well as how to operate the terminal on my computer in tandem with VS Code and GitHub. 

Saying "it was my homework" isn't the only reason I want to learn and be adept in coding. I have always been fascinated with how 
computers, smartphones, apps, and video games have worked. And given how we have entangled our lives in technology and interacting with computers,
learning how to better interact with apps and technology is fundemental. Plus, I enjoy learning for learning's sake.

I'm also interested in working in a field that incorporates coding since I have been teaching high school math for five years and have not found that 
fulfilling. That's not to poo on the education profession, but I'm ready for a change in work and environment.

Rambling aside, I hope this study guide will serve as a quick resource for those who need to remind themselves about HTML, CSS, Git, or JS. Especially
for people who have over 30 pages of written notes like myself, having a condensed version on hand will save time and effort.
