        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language".</li>
          <li>HTML provides strutcture and a basic framework to content on this webpage as well as other webpages and apps.</li>
          <li>The structure is composed of many different elements, such as text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements, etc.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE tells the browser what type of document to expect when it is accessed.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information (also metadata - not visible to users) about the webpage, such as accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user, such as lines of text, bulleted lists, levels of headers, line breaks, etc.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".</li>
          <li>CSS allows for the aesthetics of a webpage or app to be incorporated, such as color, grids, shading, etc., to better organize the webpage.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. Setting your margin as 0 means there will be no space around an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element, and more padding mean enlarging an element. The inverse is also true.</li>
          <li>There are three methods to style using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When using external CSS style sheet, this needs to be linked to the HTML file.</li>

          <li>git touch file/branch name: creates a new file in a designated folder.</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages the files by adding all changes directly to current working area branch; do this after saving any changes in VS Code.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "type message here": make a commit message; message must be in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls the source code from GitHub to ensure that we have the latest commits and changes.</li>

          <li>The command console.log() will output a message to the web console.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>When working with a group of related or unrelated data, an array can be used to hold all of that data in a single variable.</li>
          <li>The index indicates the location of an item within an array and numbers each item sequentially, beginning at 0.</li>
          <li>The for loop executes a given block of code so long as a specified condition remains true.</li>
